# logistic_regression_cat_vs_others
**Image recognition using Logistic Regression**

**The model comprises of :**

- A training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
- A test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat
- num_px = 64, m_train = 209 (Number of training examples) and m_test = 50 (Number of test examples).

**Dependencies**
- numpy
- matplotlib
- h5py
- PIL
- scipy

**Model**
- Logistic Regression

**Result :**
- Training accuracy is close to 100%
- test accuracy is 70%.
